DESCRIPTION
-----------

CGI::Log is a perl extension for centralized logging of debug, error,
status and success messages from scripts or other modules.  Debugging
messages include a call trace to give you the appropriate context around
each message.

Developed for use with CGI or mod_perl, but is not limited to those
applications.  Easy to use API allows for the same calling method to be
used from other modules, libraries or scripts.


INSTALLATION
------------

To install, unzip and untar the archive. In the directory created type:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

Note: If this does not work, you can always just copy the file 'Log.pm' to
the 'CGI' directory in your perl distribution.

If you want to test out the module without installing it, you can add the following
to your code:

	BEGIN
	{
		unshift(@INC, "/wherever/you/put/CGI/Log.pm");
	}

	use CGI::Log;


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Documentation is included in the Log.pm module in pod format.  Once CGI::Log has been installed
type:

	perldoc CGI::Log

or if is uninstalled:

	perldoc ./Log.pm

For more information on perldoc type 'perldoc perldoc'.
